Today we have a guest post by Adam Ernest who is taking over bitshares.org and our social media.  

Adams comments:

>I’m excited to have the opportunity to step in and begin directly contributing to our marketing efforts. 

>In my experience, during times of transition, it is of the utmost importance to ensure the proper tracking mechanisms are in place, in order to establish a baseline of current performance trends, prior to kicking off any new marketing initiatives.

>That being said, I intend to work with bytemaster and various members of the crew, in the days ahead, to establish our KPI’s (Key Performance Indicators) and ensure that we are able to properly track all of the events that make sense to track (from an optimization and/or reporting perspective) on the various BitShares assets we have in play.

>Once a performance baseline has been established, we will then work together to set attainable goals and put realistic timelines in place in order to achieve them, while holding ourselves accountable along the way.

>Will, myself, and our team of interns will be taking over the marketing efforts for the bitshares.org website. We welcome with open arms any input, ideas, or suggestions the rest of the BitShares community may have to offer in an effort to move the needle in the right direction with respect to the KPI’s we intend to track. 

>We will be taking the lean-startup approach, as we believe that data should drive the decision making process (as opposed to gut feelings or intuition), when it comes to the marketing channels and tactics we choose to employ to drive results. As a team, we should be continually optimizing our marketing mix, doing more of what works and less of what doesn’t, in an effort to improve performance over time.

>I’m looking forward to working with all those committed to making BitShares a success and can’t wait to get down to business in the New Year!

I would like to add some of the KPI that I am interested in.

1. Total Visitors to bitshares.org
2. Bounce Rate 
3. Download Rate 
4. Account Registration Rate
5. Referrals

We will be tracking users through the process of navigating our website, blog, bitshares.tv, and faucet.bitshares.org to discover how, when, and why potential users have problems.   Once we have metrics we can start publishing monthly updates to track the growth of our ecosystem.
