Our monetary system is built on a web of debt and deception.  Banks, and the governments that charter them, are in complete control of our financial lives.  Without their permission we cannot buy or sell online.   Without notice our bank accounts can be stolen with little recourse.  Even if you avoid banks, the governments of the world are inflating money supply and steeling your wealth from your mattress and paycheck.   Even honest companies that hold 100% reserves and attempt to provide an alternative monetary system are attacked by governments and have proven they are not viable alternatives.   This is the problem we all face.  This is what Bitcoin tries to solve.

In my opinion, we have lost track of the problem and are now enamored with the details of particular solutions.  If we do not clearly articulate the real problem then we will end up fighting over solutions to non existant problems. So, what is the real problem?

## Trust is *not* the Problem 
It doesn't take long before the phrase "trust-free" comes up in a discussion about Bitcoin.  We have all been burned so many times by the banking industrial complex that many of us have adopted a "trust no one" mindset.   This mindset is counterproductive. Without trust our entire economy would grind to a halt.  Imagine if every restraunt required you to place money in a multi-sig account prior to ordering your food.   Imagine if every cashier at every store was behind bullet proof glass.  Imagine if you had to cryptographically sign every single verbal agreement?  Imagine if every contract had to be drafted by multiple lawyers simply because you couldn't trust any centralized lawyer?  

The most effecient economy is the one that benefits from the highest level of trust.  The least effecient economy is the one where no one can trust anyone.   We should be building systems that maximize our ability to trust rather than eliminating our need to trust.    

## Centralization is *not* the Problem 

The economy functions just fine with centralized businesses that we trust to process trillions of dollars every year.  Apple probably has more money than many large financial instutions and every single year millions of customers trust them to ship multi-thousand dollar computers after pre-paying without escrow.  Every single day we trust FedEx, UPS, and the Postal Service to deliver products to our door on time.   

Sure these companies sometimes make mistakes, but these mistakes are not cause for us to stop trusting them.  I don't see any need to decentralize Apple.  The free market is already fully decentralized with maximum competition so long as the government isn't interfeering.   

Centeralization provides many benefits including effeciency and economies of scale. It is much easier to shop at Walmart than visting a half dozen mom and pop stores.  If we clammor to decentralize Walmart then the result is higher prices and a lower standard of living for everyone.   I am not the biggest fan of Walmart, but you cannot doubt that they are lowering the cost of living for millions of people.   

## The Byzantine generals are *not* the Problem 

Is it really necessary to assume that no nodes can be trusted.  This gets back to the issue where *trust* is not the problem.  There is no reason to have competitive nodes attempting to create alternative realities.  Once again we have made the problem more difficult than necessary.

## Solutions to non-existant Problems 

A lot of the complexity of Bitcoin stems from creating solutions to the above problems.  If centralization is not *the* problem then creating a P2P network is not going to help.   If Byzantine generals are not *the* problem, then proof of work is not necessary.  It is great that Bitcoin has solved many of these problems, but if we continue to focus on non-existant problems then we will lose sight of the *real* problem and potentially overlook superior solutions to the *real* problem simply because they do not also solve the non-existant problems to our satisfaction.

## What is the *real* Problem?

The real problem we face in society is debt.  In the early days you could own gold or silver as money and spend it to buy your food, shelter and clothing.  This gold and silver were the only forms of money that were not simultaneously someone else liability (aka debt).   Until Bitcoin all digital assets were a form of debt managed on a database within the banks.  Bitcoin introduced us to the first debt-free digital asset that was fungible, divisible, and had value.   This is the *real* problem that Bitcoin actually solved.

## What was the *real* Solution?

Bitcoin solved many problems, but the *real* solution was an uncensorable, irreversable, public record.  

That's it.  

The easiest way to create an uncensorable, irreversable, public record is to have a single individual host a server upon which all transactions can be submitted.  The transactions would be grouped, timestamped, and included in a blockchain that was then propagated to as many mirrors that wanted to subscribe.  

Under this system it would be easy to detect censoring and any attempt to change the record.  In fact, the server that is performing this function wouldn't even need to interpret or validate the transactions.  All that is required is that they are uniquely timestamped in an irreversable order.   

Because the server is not performing any financial operations, it is clearly operating outside any regulated industry and governments would have no legitimate grounds for taking the server down.   Even if the server did go down, it would be trivial for someone else to create an alternative server preforming the same function that picked up where it left off.   The cost of maintaining such a server would be minimal and the operator could easily charge a small fee for every certified message it processed.   

Once you have this irreversable public record it is merely a matter of interpreting the data.  Everyone around the world could run the same software and come to the same conclusion given the same data.   This is very much how CounterParty works on top of Bitcoin.   CounterParty uses the Bitcoin network as nothing more than a timestamping service for its messages.  All clients then interpret the data and discard any timestamped transactions that are invalid.   

Once you understand this it becomes much easier to see the unnecessary hoops everyone is jumping through.  Take Ripple for instance.  They have a complex protocol that involves excessive communication among many nodes to come to an agreement about the order of transactions in every single block.   What is all of that complexity buying them?  They are already adopting the mindset that "failure to agree is agreeing to fail".  Why not agree to something simpler like taking turns?   

Look at CounterParty.  They are using a very slow, innefecient timestamping service also known as the Bitcoin blockchain.   Are you telling me that the existing timestamping services provided by many companies cannot be trusted, even a group of them?  Even though they are paid and earn their living on that reputation?  

Look at Bitcoin.  Do you believe that $500 million dollars per year spent on mining is better than hiring 1000 time stamping services and paying them each $100 per month?  

Once you have a public record that can contain arbitrary data then it becomes trivial for people to expand upon the software that interprets the data.   No government is going to shut down a timestamping service.   No timestamping service is going to be able to deceive the public that is watching its every publication.   Sure the timestamping service could forge a history in secret and attempt to deceive someone isolated from the network, but that would be like believing Apple would steal from its customers just because it can.   It would be very isolated with a 100% chance of getting caught and ultimatly fired.   

Businesses do not generally commit small time fraud that has 100% certainty of getting caught.  Even a corrupt employee of a timestamping service would be unable to fool the public with a secret chain.   The key is that the *public* record is known by all and any *secret* records are ignored.   






















This solution has far fewer requirements than Bitcoin enthusiasts like to impose on alternatives.   All that is necessary is a means of establishing when something was made public and 

There are many ways to achieve an uncensorable, irreversalbe, public record and they don't necessiarlly require a P2P network or proof of work.  In fact, it could be done in a fully centralized manner with something as simple as a timestamping service and broadcast.   

Lost in the middle of these debates is whether or not we have solved the original problem.  There are a dozen ways to build a house and all of them provide adequate shelter.  Some are nicer than others, but they all solve the problem.  What I am witnessing in the Bitcoin ecosystem is that people are fighting over what color to paint the walls and how to layout the floor plan while rain is coming through the roof.   We set out to build a shelter from the financial storm all around us and lost track of our goal along the way.



The question that remains is what parts of Bitcoin are necessary to creating a debt-free digital asset and what parts are superfluous?     I contend there is only one thing that is necessary: an irreversible, globally recognized, uncensorable, official public record that anyone may contribute to.   Everything else is just decoration. Proof of work, P2P, and the notion of decentralization are red herrings.  

Is Bitcoin irreversible?  Technically No.  At the protocol level anyone at any time can do enough work to create an alternative history.  In the Bitcoin sphere the desire for “objective purity” means that consensus is arrived at without thinking.  The math alone determines the truth.  
Practically speaking, Bitcoin aims to make it difficult to reverse.  The cost to brute force reverse the Bitcoin network is about $30,000 per hour of reversal.

Is Bitcoin uncensorable?  Technically No.  If about a dozen people got together they could block any transaction they like.   These people are self selected and purchased their right to control what transactions get included into blocks.   The total cost to maintain this right is about $30,000 per hour.   Once again, it is difficult but not impossible to censor Bitcoin.  

What we can see from this is that Bitcoin has established that a perfect solution is not necessary provided it is sufficiently difficult to censor or reverse a transaction.   

Proof of Stake systems also solve the problem of creating an irreversible and uncensorable global public ledger.   Depending upon your approach you will get varying amount of speed, but most proof of stake approaches end up requiring a significant amount of capital to attack when they are the size of Bitcoin.   Proof of Stake isn’t perfect.  In practice, all proof of stake networks can be compromised by owning as little as 15% of the stake because not all stakeholders contribute to the network security.   This would total $450 million dollars worth of capital at Bitcoin’s valuation which is enough money to fund a 51% attack on Bitcoin for 2 years straight. 
Like Bitcoin, most proof of stake systems are ultimately controlled by just a few dozen individuals due to the distribution of wealth.   

Can Proof of Stake be reversed?   Under most systems it can be because like Bitcoin they rely almost entirely on the math.   Someone with a large stake can potentially produce two alternative chains and the longest chain is automatically declared official.  

Under Delegated Proof of Stake and Ripple style consensus there are no long term forks and the code marches forward.  They rely on the fact that the “public record” is irreversible.  Private alternative records are ignored regardless of how long or otherwise valid the record is.  All that is necessary is for enough nodes to stay connected at all times so as to have no dispute over what is public.   This can be verified by having a large enough number of trusted people “sign off” on having seen the record. 

## The Problem is Debt, not Trust 

Each and every day we do business with people on the basis of trust.  No one believes that your local grocery store is “too centralized” nor do they require cryptographic proof on every email.   Operating a business in public, for profit, is enough for almost every kind of transaction.  Centralization isn’t the problem.   The problem is debt.  

Once you introduce debt then even the most trustworthy individual has the potential to default.  A trustworthy bank with 100% reserves and a public ledger with continuous public audits can be shutdown by the government or robbed by thieves.   Debt is always at risk of default even by trustworthy individuals.  

It just so happens that most debt is centralized in large banks and financial institutions.  The problem isn’t the centralization, it is the debt.   After all, Apple is a large centralized company that manages more money than most financial institutions but you never see the same issues with Apple that you do with banks.   This is because Apple never puts itself in the position of owing millions of people money.   Every trade is a “value-for-value” immediate trade.  After the trade, there is no significant ongoing liability.

We all implicitly trust a half dozen miners or perhaps 50 or so large stake holders under proof of stake.   These people can be trusted and they do not owe us money.   They gain very little by attempting to rob us and generally speaking they have little to gain and much to lose by attempting to rob us. 

For all practical purposes a single company could host a blockchain and produce 100% of all blocks so long as all submitted transactions were public and everyone had a copy of the blockchain.   We could trust this company because any attempt at fraud would be detectable and unambiguous.   The probability of getting caught is near 100% thus few would dare violate the public trust.     In the event that the trust was violated, the cost of switching to another company to manage the public ledger would be relatively low.

There is only one reason that a blockchain needs “decentralization” and that is to provide seamless transition in the event of failure.  Perhaps what is really required is a distributed system with sufficient redundancies.   A government cannot erase the public record nor easily prevent any and all communication between people.   If they took down the one and only company managing the public ledger, a new company could sprout up overnight in another jurisdiction and take over.   It may result in some downtime and a slight disruption, but you can be sure that everyones property rights as documented in the public ledger would still be in tact.

## Time to Refocus 

There are many innovations going on in the crypto-currency world today, but most of them have lost sight of the problem being solved and instead aim to produce solutions without a problem.  There has been tremendous effort put into creating smart contracts and decentralized exchanges.   Light wallets are being built with the assumption that *no one can be trusted* and everything is being over-engineered to eliminate all trust at great expense and for little gain.   Ripple & Nxt both provide exchanges that allow users to issue their own assets and usually these assets take the form of an IOU.  They are not solving the debt issue.  

Moving the existing banking system from internal databases to public blockchains will not solve the problem.  Having a decentralize exchange dealing entirely in debt instruments leaves the real wealth in the hands of the same people that control it today.    

The current banking system can easily adopt a fully centralized “invite only” ledger to solve all of their “intra-bank-settlement” issues.   Ripple happens to be a relatively good solution, but is clearly burdened by unnecessary decentralization and overly complex consensus considering how it is being used. 

What no one is focusing on is how to create trust-free digital assets pegged to the value of real world assets.   What we need is digital gold that is not someone else’s liability.   This is what BitShares is trying to solve.  

Sure we provide one of the most decentralized, distributed, high speed, and democratic solutions on the market.  But it isn’t our speed or consensus algorithm that truly matters, it is our trust free 300% reserve BitAsset system.   We have created a virtual debt instrument who's collateral is held in a manner that cannot be seized nor stolen.  A system that can work with many different consensus algorithms or even on a fully centralized server.    

So next time you look at an alt-coin or Bitcoin 2.0 solution remind yourself what really matters and what is noise.  Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake is not critical to the core product, though one clearly has a lot more costs than the other.   Because it is not critical there is no reason to adopt something that is unnecessarily expensive.   Delegated Proof of Stake vs the alternatives are not critical.  Because they are not critical there is no reason to adopt anything slower than DPOS.

It is time to set aside the implementation details and focus on the actual content of our irreversible public ledgers.   














     






Since Bitcoin was launched there have been many people discussing all of the problems that Bitcoin supposedly solves.   Academics like to discuss the Byzantine generals problem while others talk about how it creates a trust-free currency.   There are many parts to Bitcoin each of which is solving a slightly different problem.   These parts include: proof of work, p2p network, public ledger, a blockchain, and cryptography.   The combination of these parts creates what we know as Bitcoin.    The question is, what has Bitcoin really solved and what parts of Bitcoin are actually irrelevant to the problem being solved?  In other words, what parts of Bitcoin are there to solve side issues rather than the main issue?

Perhaps one of the most frequently used words in the Bitcoin ecosystem is *decentralization*.  If something isn’t decentralized then it is automatically distrusted.    This begs the question, what problem does decentralization really solve?   Does decentralization solve the trust issue or is that solved by something else?

Other people discuss proof of work as being critical to solving the problem.   Does proof of work create a currency or solve trust issues?   What problem does proof of work really solve and is that problem essential to creating a trust-free currency?

Still others talk about p2p networks being critical to solving the problem of a trust-free currency.  The argument is that without a p2p
