In the crypto currency space there is a new scam accusation every single day, but 
not all scams are created equal.   In the case of BitShares, the scam is complicated
and you will need an undergraduate degree in crypto currency scams to keep up.  When 
it comes to scams there are many shades of grey, so I will present the evidence and
let you decide.

There are many types of scams that have become common in the crypto currency industry, so
lets review them first. 

### Pump & Dump 

Perhaps the most common scam is the pump and dump.  Pump and dumps are usually backed by
individuals extremely skilled in marketing and are promoting a product that is little if
any innovation aside from being a clone of another system.   Pump and dump artists focus
on generating momentum for a buying frenzy and then sell at the top.  

BitShare's has seen several major buying frenzies in its time.  

### BitShares is 100% Pre-mined 

For those of you who have been following crypto currencies for a while you have 
probably come to be suspect of every new Bitcoin clone.  The scam is simple, allocate
a lot of coins for yourself, market the coin, and then dump your pre-allocated coins on
the market.   

A well executed pre-mine has a long time horizon and very successful marketing campaign so
that the market the coin is traded on many exchanges with relatively high volume.  

BitShares has been under development since July 2013 and has produced several intermediate 
coins that have been pumped up to $30 dollars per coin before crashing all the way down to
just $0.25 per coin.  This intermediate coin was known as ProtoShares, was renamed to
BitShares PTS and has recently relaunched on a new blockchain.  

ProtoShares (BitShares PTS) was announced weeks prior to the first block being mined. Binaries 
were released
